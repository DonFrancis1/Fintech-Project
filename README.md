The Case

Predictive Analytics of Credit Writing
Last year, Stripe, a software technology company based in San Francisco decided to invest 2.9 million USD in CredPal. As part of the journey to understanding consumer’s saving capability, Stripe developed an internal project with the aim of analyzing consumers’ spending habits at different levels and regions. This analysis is critical because it aims to demonstrate the scalability of the CredPal solution and validate its argument that users (from different countries) have a spending pattern and a capability to save.
Although your team disagrees with the objective of the study, yet you are supposed to work with a team of 10 to analyze the data set and extract relevant intelligence to help guide the investment team from Stripe.
Cheers.
